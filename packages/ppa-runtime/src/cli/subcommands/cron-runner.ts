/**
 * Cron runner resolution for `letta cron` (LET-9692).
 *
 * Two runners own scheduled tasks:
 * - "local": the runtime-local scheduler (~/.letta/crons.json), executed by
 *   the WS listener process on this device. Dies with the device/sandbox.
 * - "cloud": durable Cloud schedules (`/v1/agents/:id/schedule`), fired by a
 *   cloud worker into a target listener or the agent's managed Cloud sandbox.
 *
 * Default policy: cloud agents get the cloud runner everywhere. When no runner
 * or computer is explicit, creation preserves execution locality: an external
 * listener becomes the schedule's target, and a managed sandbox runtime keeps
 * the untargeted schedule (which already fires in the agent's Cloud sandbox).
 * `--runner cloud` deliberately selects the managed Cloud sandbox;
 * `--runner local` selects process-local storage. Local-backend agents
 * (`agent-local-*`) always use the local runner, and servers that don't serve
 * the Cloud schedule routes (self-hosted OSS core) fall back to it.
 *
 * Cloud support is determined by probing the schedule route, not by
 * inspecting the base URL: managed sandboxes and Desktop sessions point
 * LETTA_BASE_URL at a localhost proxy that forwards to the Letta API, so URL
 * shape says nothing about capability.
