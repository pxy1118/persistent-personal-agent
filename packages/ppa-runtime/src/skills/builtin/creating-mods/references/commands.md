# Mod command recipes

Use commands when the human explicitly invokes `/foo`.

For complex command-driven mods with panels, timers, local state, or background model work, also read `architecture.md`.

## Decide command vs skill vs tool

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `/foo` expands to a prompt | Mod command |
| `/foo` starts a complex reusable workflow | Skill + thin mod command |
| Model should call the capability by itself | Mod tool |
| Command needs transient UI while doing local work | Mod command + panel |
| Command needs model output while the main agent is busy | `runWhenBusy: true` command + forked `ctx.conversation` |

If the command represents a reusable agent workflow (for example `/goal`), put the workflow instructions in a skill and keep the command as a small launcher/prompt.

## Command IDs

- Do not include the leading slash. Use `id: "review"`, not `id: "/review"`.
- Use a lowercase slug with letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
- Built-in commands like `/reload`, `/model`, `/statusline`, etc. can be overridden by trusted local mods. Do this intentionally and keep recovery in mind: start with `--no-mods` or `LETTA_DISABLE_MODS=1` if an override breaks command handling.
- Duplicate mod command IDs fail unless `override: true` is intentional.

## Prompt command

Use `prompt` for normal slash shortcuts that should become the next agent turn. Prompt commands are not busy-safe.

```ts
export default function activate(letta) {
  if (!letta.capabilities.commands) return;

  return letta.commands.register({
    id: "review",
    description: "Review current git changes",
    args: "[focus]",
    run(ctx) {
      const focus = ctx.args.trim();
      return {
        type: "prompt",
        content: focus
          ? `Review current git changes. Focus on ${focus}.`
          : "Review current git changes. Focus on correctness issues.",
        systemReminder: true,
      };
    },
  });
}
```

## Output-only command

Use `output` for local results that do not need the model.

```ts
export default function activate(letta) {
  if (!letta.capabilities.commands) return;

  return letta.commands.register({
    id: "whereami",
    description: "Show the active mod command context",
    run(ctx) {
      return {
        type: "output",
        output: `Agent: ${ctx.agent.name ?? ctx.agent.id}\nCWD: ${ctx.cwd}`,
      };
    },
  });
}
```

## Panel command

Use `{ type: "handled" }` when the command owns the UI. Guard panels because they are optional on non-TUI surfaces.

```ts
export default function activate(letta) {
  if (!letta.capabilities.commands) return;

  return letta.commands.register({
    id: "hello-panel",
    description: "Show a short transient panel",
    showInTranscript: false,
    run(ctx) {
      if (!letta.capabilities.ui.panels) {
        return { type: "output", output: `hello ${ctx.args || "there"}` };
      }

      const greeting = `hello ${ctx.args || "there"}`;
      const panel = letta.ui.openPanel({
        id: "hello-panel",
        render: () => greeting,
      });
      setTimeout(() => panel.close(), 5_000);
      return { type: "handled" };
    },
  });
}
```

## Busy-safe conversation command

For commands with `runWhenBusy: true`, do not return `prompt` while the agent is running. Use the scoped conversation handle directly, update a panel/status if available, and return `{ type: "handled" }` quickly.

Use `ctx.conversation` for conversation operations that should work across local and Letta Cloud backends. The handle is bound to the active conversation and backend for that command invocation, so composed flows like fork-then-send stay on the same backend. Use `letta.client` only for server-specific API calls.

Common pattern:

```ts
const forked = await ctx.conversation.fork({ hidden: true });

const stream = await forked.sendMessageStream([
  { role: "user", content: input },
]);
```

Do not send directly to the active conversation from a busy command; fork first unless the user explicitly asked to affect the main conversation later.

For a worked multi-capability mod that combines commands, tools, events, permissions, and local state, see `plan-mode.md`.
