# Channel plugins

Letta Code channels connect agents to external chat systems. Telegram, Slack,
and Discord are first-party bundled plugins with custom Desktop UI. User-defined
plugins are loaded from `~/.letta/channels/<channel-id>/` and run headlessly:
they can receive inbound messages, participate in pairing/routing, and extend
the shared `MessageChannel` tool, but they do not get custom Desktop screens.

## Directory layout

```text
~/.letta/channels/
  whatsapp/
    channel.json
    plugin.mjs
    accounts.json
    routing.yaml
    pairing.yaml
    runtime/
      package.json
      node_modules/
```

`channel.json` registers the plugin:

```json
{
  "id": "whatsapp",
  "displayName": "WhatsApp",
  "entry": "./plugin.mjs",
  "runtimePackages": ["@whiskeysockets/baileys@6.7.18"],
  "runtimeModules": ["@whiskeysockets/baileys"]
}
```

Rules:

- `id` must match the directory name and use lowercase letters, numbers,
  `_`, or `-`.
- `entry` is resolved relative to the channel directory.
- `runtimePackages` are installed into `runtime/` by
  `letta channels install <id>`.
- `runtimeModules` are resolved from bundled first-party runtimes first, then
  from the user channel `runtime/` directory.

## Plugin entry

`plugin.mjs` exports either `channelPlugin` or `default`:

```js
export const channelPlugin = {
  metadata: {
    id: "whatsapp",
    displayName: "WhatsApp",
    runtimePackages: ["@whiskeysockets/baileys@6.7.18"],
    runtimeModules: ["@whiskeysockets/baileys"]
  },

  async createAdapter(account) {
    return {
      id: `whatsapp:${account.accountId}`,
      channelId: "whatsapp",
      accountId: account.accountId,
      name: account.displayName ?? "WhatsApp",
      async start() {},
      async stop() {},
      isRunning() { return false; },
      async sendMessage(message) { return { messageId: crypto.randomUUID() }; },
      async sendDirectReply(chatId, text) {},
      onMessage: undefined
    };
  },

  messageActions: {
    describeMessageTool() {
      return { actions: ["send"] };
    },
    async handleAction({ adapter, request, formatText }) {
      const formatted = formatText(request.message ?? "");
      const result = await adapter.sendMessage({
        channel: request.channel,
        chatId: request.chatId,
        text: formatted.text,
        parseMode: formatted.parseMode,
        threadId: request.threadId
      });
      return `Message sent to ${request.channel} (message_id: ${result.messageId})`;
    }
  }
};
```

## Account model

All channels share the same persisted account envelope:

```ts
type ChannelAccount = {
  channel: string;
  accountId: string;
  displayName?: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  dmPolicy: "pairing" | "allowlist" | "open";
  allowedUsers: string[];
  config: Record<string, unknown>;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

The `config` object is plugin-owned and may contain secrets. In the custom
plugin MVP, Desktop/websocket responses do not echo this object back; they only
include a generic redacted config summary. First-party bundled plugins can keep
custom redaction/compatibility adapters because they also have bespoke Desktop
UI.

First-party bundled plugins may keep compatibility with their older account
fields internally, but user plugins should only rely on `account.config`.

## Runtime behavior

The MVP runtime path supports custom plugins that fit the generic pairing and
routing flow:

1. The adapter receives an inbound message and calls `adapter.onMessage(msg)`.
2. Letta Code enforces `dmPolicy` / `allowedUsers`.
3. Letta Code resolves a route from `routing.yaml` or creates a pairing code.
4. The routed message is delivered to the bound agent/conversation.
5. ChannelGateway registers `MessageChannel` for the conversation when it has an
   active route on at least one running channel adapter.

Plugins that need Slack/Discord-style auto-routing or rich Desktop management
remain first-party/bundled work for now. Custom plugins can still expose custom
`MessageChannel` actions and schema fragments via `messageActions`.

> Note: inbound channel delivery and user-visible replies are separate steps.
> A channel message can successfully reach the agent, but the agent still has to
> call `MessageChannel` to reply. If the transcript shows the incoming
> `<channel-notification>` but no `MessageChannel` tool call, this is usually a
> model/prompting issue rather than a channel adapter failure. For debugging,
> check whether the notification reached the conversation, whether the agent
> called `MessageChannel`, whether the tool result says the message was sent,
> and whether the route/account IDs match the original chat.

## Local backend channels

Channels can run against the experimental local backend without registering a
remote computer. In this mode the backend is in-process, so no
`LETTA_BASE_URL` is required.

```bash
letta channels install telegram
letta channels configure telegram
letta server --backend local --channels telegram
```

Then send the bot a message to get a pairing code and bind it to the local agent
and conversation:

```bash
letta channels pair \
  --channel telegram \
  --code XXXXXX \
  --agent <agent-id> \
  --conversation default
```

Only set `LETTA_BASE_URL` for a separate self-hosted server. For example,
`LETTA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8283 letta server --channels telegram` talks to
a server running at that URL. Do not set a dummy `LETTA_BASE_URL` for
`--backend local`.

## Channel slash commands

Typed slash commands are handled before normal channel ingress so operational
commands do not get delivered to the agent as regular user messages. The shared
channel command set is:

- `/status` — show account, listener, route, agent, and conversation state.
- `/pause` — disable agent replies for the current routed chat.
- `/resume` — re-enable agent replies for the current routed chat.
- `/cancel` — abort the in-progress agent turn for the current routed chat.
- `/chat` — show the Letta web chat link for the current route.
- `/whoami` — show the sender's access scope, tier, and runnable commands.
- `/reflection` — start a memory reflection pass for the current route's agent
  conversation when MemFS is enabled.

Slack-native slash command payloads currently exist only for `/cancel`; the rest
are expected to be sent as normal channel messages in the relevant chat/thread.

## Access control

Sender access is decided centrally (`access-control.ts`) on every inbound
message — DMs and groups, on every channel including auto-routed Slack/Discord
traffic — before commands or routing run.

Per-account fields (in `accounts.json`, snake_case):

- `dm_policy` — `"open"`, `"allowlist"`, or `"pairing"` for direct messages.
  Slack note: `"pairing"` is a legacy unenforced default on Slack and behaves
  as `"open"`; use `"allowlist"` to restrict Slack DMs.
- `allowed_users` — sender IDs allowed regardless of policy. `"*"` allows
  everyone. WhatsApp/Signal entries match through identity normalization
  (phone digits / UUID vs E.164).
- `group_policy` — `"open"` (default, historical behavior) or `"allowlist"`,
  which restricts group/channel senders to the allowlists below plus paired
  users.
- `admin_users` — enables slash-command tiers when non-empty: admins run
  everything; other users get the read-only floor (`/help`, `/status`,
  `/whoami`) plus `user_allowed_commands`. When unset, every allowed user has
  full command access.
- `user_allowed_commands` — extra commands non-admins may run.

Env vars (comma-separated user IDs; merged with account config):

- `LETTA_CHANNELS_ALLOWED_USERS` / `LETTA_<CHANNEL>_ALLOWED_USERS` — global /
  per-channel allowlists. Once configured, they restrict all scopes (DMs and
  groups) on the affected channels.
- `LETTA_CHANNELS_ADMIN_USERS` / `LETTA_<CHANNEL>_ADMIN_USERS` — admin tiers.
- `LETTA_CHANNELS_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=1` / `LETTA_<CHANNEL>_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=1` —
  explicit opt-out of sender gating.

Pairing approvals are a union with the allowlists: a paired sender stays
allowed in any scope, and allowlisted senders skip the pairing handshake.

## Slack app manifest notes

The bundled Slack channel runs in Socket Mode. The Slack app must still declare
the events, scopes, and slash commands that Slack should deliver to Letta Code.
For `/cancel`, add the `commands` bot scope and a native slash command entry:

```yaml
features:
  slash_commands:
    - command: /cancel
      url: https://example.com/slack/commands
      description: Cancel the in-progress Letta agent turn
      usage_hint: ""
      should_escape: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:history
      - chat:write
      - commands
      - files:read
      - files:write
      - groups:history
      - im:history
      - reactions:read
      - reactions:write
      - users:read
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.channels
      - message.groups
      - message.im
      - reaction_added
      - reaction_removed
  socket_mode_enabled: true
```

Slack-native slash command payloads do not identify a thread. If `/cancel` is
sent through Slack's native command UI in a channel, Letta Code can target the
sole routed thread in that channel; if multiple Letta threads are routed there,
send `/cancel` as a normal thread message instead so the thread route is
unambiguous.

The slash command `url` is present because Slack manifests require one; the
Socket Mode listener receives the command over the app-level WebSocket.

### Per-channel mention-only Slack bots

By default, once a Slack bot participates in a thread, subsequent human replies
in that thread route to the agent without another mention. To require an
explicit `@mention` in selected channels, add their Slack channel IDs to the
account's `mention_only_channels` list in
`~/.letta/channels/slack/accounts.json`:

```json
{
  "mention_only_channels": ["C0123456789"]
}
```

This policy is account-specific and applies even to threads where that bot has
already participated. Add the channel ID to every bot account that should require
an explicit mention. In listed channels, unmentioned messages and reaction
events do not start agent turns. Direct messages, native Slack slash commands,
and channels not listed here retain their existing behavior.

Keep both `app_mention` and the broad `message.channels` / `message.groups`
subscriptions when only selected channels should be mention-only. Removing the
broad message events makes mention-only delivery apply to the whole Slack app
instead. Restart the listener after editing `accounts.json` so the running Slack
adapter loads the new policy.


## First-party vs user plugins

First-party plugins are bundled in `src/channels/<id>/` and registered by the
built-in registry. They can have bespoke Desktop UI and compatibility shims.

User plugins are discovered from `~/.letta/channels/<id>/channel.json`. They are
intentionally headless in this MVP. They should be configured by editing
`accounts.json` or by sending generic websocket/CLI account updates whose
plugin-owned fields live under `config` / `plugin_config`.
